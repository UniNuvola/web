# Vault in a Docker Container üêã

This folder contains the config files for run Vault within a Docker Container.
This configuration is designed to run Vault in _Server mode_,
so that any information and configurations are persisted at every restart.
Each time the Docker container starts up, Vault will start in _Sealed mode_, allowing any operation to be performed
by undergoing an Unsealing procedure. This procedure, as well as all the deploy process, is automated by the `vault.py` cli tool.

## CLI tool and Auto-deploy

This script is designed to manage the creation of a new instance of Vault entirely autonomously.
It can be launched as a single command to perform the entire procedure or invoked step-by-step for specific needs.
For now, commands do not accept parameters, but in the future it may be modified to make everything more
general and complete.

The script will automatically generate the `.env` file containing access keys to Vault and necessary for running some
commands in standalone mode.
