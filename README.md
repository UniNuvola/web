# Web üåé

## Setup

Install python dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

```bash
poetry install
```

Then create a `.env` file to store the Vault credentials

```
VAULT_CLIENT_ID=
VAULT_CLIENT_SECRET=
VAULT_API_BASE_URL=
VAULT_CONF_URL=
SECRET_KEY=
ADMIN_USERS=
```

> [!NOTE]
> - `VAULT_API_BASE_URL` should be similar to `<ip>/v1/`.
> - `VAULT_CONF_URL` should be similar to `<ip>/v1/identity/oidc/provider/<provider>/.well-known/openid-configuration`. The `<provider>` string should be `default`.
> - **DON'T FORGET THE PROTOCOL (`http://` or `https://`) BEFORE THE `<ip>` STRING !!**
> - `SECRET_KEY` should be invented (not provided by Voult).
> - `ADMIN_USERS` must be a list of users id. Something like this `ADMIN_USERS='["alice.alice@alice.it", "prova@unipg.it", "eliasforna@gmail.com"]'`.
> - Replace email with usernames or whatever you want. Be careful with `'` and `"`, these must be used exactly as in the example.

    ```
    If not specified use the default values
1. Create !
1. Open the **Scope** section, and "Create scope"
1. Fill the following fields
    ```
    Name: default
    Descriptio:
    JSON template: 
    {
        "contact": {
            "email": {{identity.entity.metadata.email}},
            "username": {{identity.entity.metadata.username}}
        }
    }
    ```
1. Go back to **Provider** section and then on "default" and "Edit provider"
